"""Host tunnel frame schema for ``omnigent host``.

Host-specific frame kinds, all JSON (see :class:`HostFrameKind`),
plus reuse of ``PingFrame``/``PongFrame`` from the runner tunnel
for keepalive.

Host frames carry only control messages (launch/stop runner
requests and their results). They do NOT carry HTTP
request/response traffic — runners connect directly to the server
with their own tunnels.

This module is intentionally separate from the runner tunnel's
``frames.py`` to keep the two protocols partitioned. The runner
module has a closed ``FrameKind`` enum and ``decode_frame`` match
statement that handles all runner frame kinds. Adding host kinds
there would force runner-side decoders to handle frames they never
see.
