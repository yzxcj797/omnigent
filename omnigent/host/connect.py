        :class:`subprocess.Popen` (``poll()`` / ``.returncode``) for the
        ``host.runner_exited`` report. A blind ``waitpid(-1)`` reaper that
        consumes a just-crashed tracked runner makes ``Popen.poll()`` report
        a bogus exit 0 (verified) — the crash cause is lost. So the reaper
        must drain orphans while leaving tracked runners' status intact.

        Two implementations, same guarantee:

        * **Linux/POSIX with** ``os.waitid`` — *peek* at the next reapable
          child with ``WNOWAIT`` (does not consume). Reap it only if it is
          not a tracked runner; if it is, stop the sweep and let the runner's
          own Popen reaper (``_watch_runner``) consume it. Cleanest: a tracked
          runner's status is never touched.
        * **Platforms without** ``os.waitid`` **(e.g. macOS)** — ``waitpid``
          has no peek, so reap with ``WNOHANG`` and, if the reaped pid is a
          tracked runner, re-inject its exit status onto the ``Popen`` so
          ``_watch_runner`` still reports the true code. Safe because
          ``_reap_orphans_once`` runs to completion on the event loop without
          awaiting, so it cannot interleave with ``_watch_runner`` /
          ``_handle_stop``.

        This runs only when the host is PID 1 (container) or a child
        subreaper (:func:`_install_child_subreaper`); otherwise no orphan
        ever reparents here and every sweep is a no-op.

        :returns: Count of orphan (non-runner) processes reaped this sweep.
