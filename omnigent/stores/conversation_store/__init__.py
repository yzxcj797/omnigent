# Label set on a fork of a session that had a working directory. Its
# value is the source session id. Presence marks the (unbound) clone as
# needing a host + working directory before it can run, so the
# online-dot reports it offline until bound and the UI opens the
# directory picker instead of silently dropping the first message.
# Forks of chat-only sources (no workspace) get no label and resume
# in-process like a brand-new chat session. Canonical home is the store
# layer; the server route and the SQLAlchemy store both import it.
FORK_SOURCE_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.fork.source_id"

# One-shot fork directive: the SOURCE session's runtime-native session id
# (e.g. the source claude-native Claude Code session uuid), stamped on the
# clone at fork time when the source had one. A native harness launching
# the (still-unbound) clone uses it to locate the source's local transcript
# and clone it into the clone's OWN project dir under a freshly assigned
# uuid (rewriting sessionId/cwd), then launch plain ``--resume <our_uuid>``
# (see ``omnigent.claude_native._clone_claude_transcript`` and the
# fork-resume branch in ``omnigent.runner.app``), so the clone opens with
# the prior history instead of a blank session. Once the clone captures its
# OWN native session id (``external_session_id`` set on first launch), this
# directive is inert — the launch path only consults it while
# ``external_session_id`` is still NULL. Cleared/ignored thereafter.
FORK_SOURCE_EXTERNAL_SESSION_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.fork.source_external_session_id"

# Fork directive: set when the fork binds a NATIVE target harness
# (claude-native / codex-native) whose history should carry over. A native
# CLI ignores the Omnigent transcript, so the runner rebuilds the target's
# on-disk transcript before launch. Two rebuild paths share this directive:
# when the source was a SAME-FAMILY native session its captured
# ``external_session_id`` is also stamped (see
# FORK_SOURCE_EXTERNAL_SESSION_LABEL_KEY) and the runner clones that
# transcript; otherwise (an SDK or cross-family source) the runner builds
# the native transcript from the fork's copied Omnigent items
# (``_ensure_local_claude_resume_transcript`` /
# ``_ensure_local_codex_resume_rollout`` — the converters consume Omnigent's
# normalized item shape, so the source harness doesn't matter). Set by the
# route whenever the target is native. Inert once the clone captures its
# own native session id (the launch path consults it only while
# ``external_session_id`` is NULL).
FORK_CARRY_HISTORY_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.fork.carry_history"

# Set by an in-place agent switch (``POST /v1/sessions/{id}/switch-agent``):
# the BUILT-IN agent id the session was switched away from, so the UI can
# offer a one-click "Switch back". A convenience pointer only — switching
# back is a fresh re-clone of that built-in (a new session-scoped agent,
# fresh harness), not a transactional undo. Persisted (not instance-scoped),
# so it survives across turns and is overwritten by each subsequent switch.
SWITCH_PREVIOUS_BUILTIN_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.switch.previous_builtin_id"

# Opt-in DANGEROUS launch directive for a codex-native session: when set to
# ``"1"`` the runner launches Codex with
# ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`` and puts the app-server
# threads into the matching no-approval / no-sandbox stance (see
# ``omnigent.runner.app._codex_native_launch_config`` and
# ``codex_native_app_server.build_codex_remote_args``). Stored as a plain
# conversation label (cheap thread metadata, like the fork directives above)
# so it survives reload without a schema migration. The web UI gates turning
# this on behind a typed confirmation + a persistent red warning banner; any
# value other than ``"1"`` (incl. absent) leaves the session in Codex's
# normal approval/sandbox stance.
CODEX_NATIVE_BYPASS_SANDBOX_LABEL_KEY = "omnigent.codex_native.bypass_sandbox"

# Reserved label key that stores a session's sidebar "project" membership
# (implicit collections — a project exists while ≥1 session carries this key).
# Namespaced so it never collides with the user-facing "project" term or other
# reserved keys, and is filtered out of generic label surfaces. Canonical home
# is the store layer; the SQLAlchemy store and the server route both import it,
# and the web client mirrors the literal as ``PROJECT_LABEL_KEY``.
PROJECT_LABEL_KEY = "omni_project"

# Reserved label-key PREFIX that records whether a session is "pinned" in the
# sidebar. Pins are PER-USER: the stored key is ``omnigent.pinned.<user_id>``
# (see :func:`pinned_label_key`), so pinning a session shared with others does
# not pin it for them, and either party can pin/unpin independently — matching
# the prior per-user localStorage behaviour. The value is the epoch-ms pin time
# (any non-empty value means pinned; the row is deleted on unpin), which lets
# the sidebar order the Pinned section by pin recency (stable under a new
# message bumping ``updated_at``) and keeps the Cmd+1..0 hotkey slots consistent
# across a user's devices. Server-side persistence lets a pin follow the user
# across devices.
#
# The bare ``omnigent.pinned`` (no user suffix) is the CANONICAL key the web
# client reads/writes; the server rewrites it to the caller's per-user key on
# write and collapses the caller's per-user key back to it on read (see
# ``_build_session_list_item``), so the per-user dimension never crosses the
# API boundary — a viewer never sees another user's pin key. The web client
# mirrors the canonical key as ``PINNED_LABEL_KEY``.

# are ``String(128)`` elsewhere (SSO subject ids can be long), so a raw suffix
# could overflow the key column — Postgres errors, MySQL silently truncates (and
# two long ids could then collide on the truncated key). To stay safe while

# Labels that must NOT cross into a new session context — deliberately

#
#   * Runtime state bound to ONE running instance — the native bridge-id
#     labels would route the new context's terminal + web injection to the
#     SOURCE's claude/codex bridge (whose active-session marker isn't the
#     clone → "session no longer active"); the context-size metrics would
#     display the source's last usage. The bridge-id literals mirror the
#     harness modules' ``*_BRIDGE_ID_LABEL_KEY`` constants; a store test
#     cross-checks them so a rename in those modules fails loudly here.
#
#   * Per-context safety opt-in — the DANGEROUS codex full-bypass directive
#     (:data:`CODEX_NATIVE_BYPASS_SANDBOX_LABEL_KEY`). Letting it ride into a
#     fork (a new session + workspace) or survive an agent switch would
#     silently re-arm ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`` with no
#     typed re-confirmation and no banner, violating the "impossible to

            table on the existing indexed FK. Ordering still

            re-sort by task timestamps. This matters for

            conversation whose own ``updated_at`` is newest
            (bumped on every item append), which lines up
            with what users expect from "the conversation I
            most recently *did anything in*". Powers the

            *this YAML* registers as) — see
            ``designs/RUN_OMNIGENT_SESSION_RESUMPTION.md``. ``None``
            disables the filter.
        :param agent_name: When set, only return conversations
            whose bound ``conversations.agent_id`` points at an
            agent row with this name. This is intentionally name-
            based so session-scoped agents created by multipart
            ``POST /v1/sessions`` remain resumable without sharing
            a template ``agent_id``. ``None`` disables the filter.
        :param has_agent_id: When ``True``, only return
            conversations whose ``agent_id`` column is not
            ``None`` — i.e. sessions created via
            ``POST /v1/sessions``. When ``None`` (default), the
            filter is disabled. Powers the ``GET /v1/sessions``
            list endpoint.

            (``search_text``). ``None`` or empty string disables
            the filter. A conversation matches if its title
            contains the query OR any of its items' search text
            does. Powers the sidebar's session search on
            ``GET /v1/sessions?search_query=...``.
        :param accessible_by: When set, filter to sessions the
            user has access to via ``session_permissions``. Uses
            a UNION subquery: sessions the user has a direct
            grant on, plus sessions with a ``"__public__"`` grant.
            ``None`` disables the filter (returns all sessions).
        :param owned_by: When set, filter to sessions the user
            *owns* (an ``owner``-level grant), a stricter form of
            ``accessible_by`` that excludes sessions merely shared
            with them. Powers the per-project folder fetch, since
            projects only ever hold the owner's own sessions.
            ``None`` disables the filter.
        :param include_archived: When ``False`` (default), archived
            conversations are excluded. When ``True``, archived and
            non-archived conversations are both returned (the caller
            groups them). Powers the sidebar's "Show archived" toggle.
        :param project: Filter by project NAME, dual-reading the
            first-class projects entity and the legacy ``omni_project``
            label (the sidebar's per-project folder fetch). A non-empty
            string returns sessions that EITHER have a first-class
            membership (``metadata.project_id`` → ``owned_by``'s project of
            this name) OR carry the ``omni_project`` label with this value.
            ``""`` returns sessions with NEITHER (unfiled). ``None`` disables
            the filter. The name→id resolution is owner-scoped (projects are
            owner-private), so pass ``owned_by`` alongside a specific name.
            See ``designs/PROJECTS_PRD.md``.
        :param pinned: When ``True``, only return sessions ``pinned_owner`` has
            pinned (their per-user ``omnigent.pinned.<user>`` label — the
            sidebar's Pinned section). ``False`` (default) disables the filter.
        :param pinned_owner: The user whose pins ``pinned=True`` filters to
            (their per-user key). ``None`` → the single-user ``local`` sentinel.
            Ignored unless ``pinned`` is ``True``.
        :param title: When set, only return conversations whose
            ``title`` matches exactly. ``None`` disables the filter.
            Powers the ``(agent, title)`` child-session lookup in
            ``sys_session_send`` so the server can resolve the target
            in a single indexed query instead of fetching all children.

            cloned agent row. Ignored unless
            ``cloned_agent_bundle_location`` is set.
        :param copy_model_settings: When ``True`` (default), copy the
            source's ``model_override`` / ``reasoning_effort``. When
            ``False``, both are left ``None`` so the fork falls back to
            the bound agent's defaults — used when the fork switches to
            an agent in a different provider family, where the source's
            model id is meaningless (a model is provider-bound).
        :param copy_terminal_launch_args: When ``True`` (default), copy the
            source's ``terminal_launch_args``. When ``False``, the fork starts
            with none — used when the fork switches to a different CLI, where
            the source's flags are meaningless or rejected (e.g. Claude Code's
            ``--permission-mode`` would make ``pi`` exit at launch).
        :param carry_history_into_native: When ``True``, stamp
            :data:`FORK_CARRY_HISTORY_LABEL_KEY` on the fork so a native
            target harness rebuilds its transcript (clone the source's
            native transcript, or build from the copied Omnigent items) instead
            of starting fresh. Set by the route only for native targets whose
            harness can replay fork history.
        :param resume_source_native_session: When ``True`` (default), a
            full fork of a source with a native session stamps
            :data:`FORK_SOURCE_EXTERNAL_SESSION_LABEL_KEY` so the runner
            clones the source's local native transcript. ``False`` when the
            fork switches to an agent in a DIFFERENT provider family: the
            source's native transcript is the wrong format for the target
            harness, so the directive is skipped and the runner builds the
            native transcript from the copied Omnigent items instead.
        :param presentation_labels: When not ``None``, replace the source's
            harness-presentation labels (``omnigent.ui`` /
            ``omnigent.wrapper``) on the clone with these. Used when the
            fork switches agents so the clone's UI mode matches the TARGET
            harness: a native target supplies ``{ui: terminal, wrapper:
            ...}``; an SDK target supplies ``{}`` (drop them → chat mode).
            ``None`` (default, same-agent fork) keeps the copied labels.
        :param up_to_response_id: When set, copy only the items up to and
            including the last item of this response (by position), e.g.
            ``"resp_abc123"`` — a "fork from this response" truncation.
            A truncated fork drops the source's external-session fork
            directive so a native target rebuilds its transcript from the
            truncated items instead of resuming the full source
            transcript; when the response is the source's last one, the
            copy is equivalent to a full fork and the directive is kept.
            ``None`` (default) copies the full history.
        :param project_id: First-class project to file the fork into
            (``metadata.project_id``), or ``None`` (default) to leave it
            unfiled. The caller resolves whether the fork keeps the
            source's project — projects are owner-private, so the route
            passes the source's id only when the forker owns it.
