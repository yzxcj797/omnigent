"""
Kubernetes sandbox launcher.

Implements the managed-launch subset of
:class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher` for an
agent-runner Job spawned on demand in a Kubernetes cluster. This module ships
in the OSS build; the official ``kubernetes`` Python client is an optional
dependency (``pip install 'omnigent[kubernetes]'``) imported lazily, so the
provider can be listed and the module probed without it.

The model is **entrypoint-as-host**: the Job's Pod template container command IS
``omnigent host``. :meth:`~KubernetesSandboxLauncher.provision` only RESERVES
the Job name (no Job yet); :meth:`~KubernetesSandboxLauncher.start_host` then
creates the Job — an init container prepares the workspace (``mkdir`` + optional
``git clone``) and the main container runs the host under a tiny PID-1 reaper,
which dials back over the existing managed launch-token tunnel. Because the host
is never started by ``exec``-ing into an already-running container, this launcher
needs no ``pods/exec`` rights and no exec transport — it implements only
``prepare`` / ``provision`` / ``start_host`` / ``resume`` / ``terminate``.

Platform notes that shape this launcher:

- **Token via Secret.** The launch token rides a per-Job Kubernetes Secret
  referenced by ``secretKeyRef`` — never the Pod spec, an exec request URI, or
  any audit-logged surface. Harness LLM credentials ride a pre-created Secret
  projected via ``envFrom`` (``sandbox.kubernetes.secret_name``).
- **Writable HOME.** The host image's WORKDIR is ``/root`` (root-owned), but
  the Pod runs as the image's non-root ``sandbox`` user (:data:`_RUN_AS_UID`)
  for least privilege, so ``$HOME`` would be unwritable. The Pod sets ``HOME``
  to :data:`_HOME_DIR`, mounts an ``emptyDir`` there shared by both containers,
  and ``fsGroup`` makes it group-writable. When the host receives a literal
  ``OMNIGENT_CONFIG_HOME``, the init container receives the same value so its
  config injection lands where the host loader reads it.
- **PID-1 reaper.** The in-sandbox host re-parents orphaned runner processes to
  PID 1, so the container command is a tiny supervisor that spawns
  ``omnigent host``, reaps any children, and forwards SIGTERM for prompt,
  graceful termination.
- **Least privilege.** ``automountServiceAccountToken: false`` keeps the runner
  SA's (absent) rights out of the sandbox, the Pod runs as a non-root user,
  drops all capabilities, and disables privilege escalation. The root
  filesystem stays writable (the host writes ``/tmp`` and ``~/.omnigent``).
- **No CLI bootstrap / port forward.** Like Modal/Daytona/Islo, the launcher
  exists for server-managed hosts only.

    Pure: no SDK import, no I/O — the manifest is a literal dict the caller
    hands to ``create_namespaced_job``, which makes it the primary unit-test
    surface for every security / lifecycle decision baked into a sandbox Job.

    The Pod template is wrapped in a ``batch/v1 Job`` with
    ``restartPolicy: OnFailure`` so the kubelet automatically restarts a
    crashed host container with exponential backoff (10 s, 20 s, 40 s, …
    capped at 5 min).  The Job's ``backoffLimit`` caps the total retry count,
    and ``activeDeadlineSeconds`` enforces a hard lifetime.  Because
    ``OnFailure`` restarts the SAME Pod in place, the Pod name is stable
    across retries — the token Secret ``secretKeyRef`` keeps resolving and the
    ``sandbox_id`` tracking in the managed-host machinery is unaffected.

    The host's existing WebSocket reconnect logic (exponential backoff in
    ``omnigent/host/connect.py``) re-registers the tunnel automatically after
    a container restart.  Combined with the runner's durable conversation
    checkpointing, an incomplete turn is auto-recovered on session re-init.

    No liveness probe is added: the PID-1 reaper propagates the child's exit
    status (``_REAPER_SRC``), so a crashed host exits the container and
    ``OnFailure`` restarts it.  A ``pgrep``-based probe would match the
    reaper's own argv (which contains ``omnigent host``), making it unable to
    detect a dead child — and it would also require ``procps`` in the image,
    which custom operator images may omit.

    The encoded design:

    - An **init container** (:data:`_INIT_CONTAINER_NAME`) creates the workspace
      and clones the repository; the **main container**
      (:data:`_CONTAINER_NAME`) runs ``omnigent host`` under the PID-1 reaper.
      Both share the writable-HOME ``emptyDir``.
    - ``restartPolicy: OnFailure`` — a crashed host is automatically restarted
      by the kubelet within the Job's ``backoffLimit``.
    - ``automountServiceAccountToken: false`` — a compromised agent cannot reach
      the API with the runner SA.
    - The launch token is referenced via ``secretKeyRef`` (never in the spec);
      the host identity rides literal env; harness credentials are projected via
      ``envFrom`` when *harness_secret* is set.
    - Pod + container ``securityContext`` satisfy Pod Security "restricted"
      (runAsNonRoot as the image's ``sandbox`` user :data:`_RUN_AS_UID`, drop ALL
      caps, ``seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault``, no privilege escalation). The
      root filesystem stays writable (the host writes ``/tmp`` + ``~/.omnigent``).
    - ``kubernetes.io/arch: amd64`` is the default; a *node_selector* entry for
      that key overrides it (e.g. ``arm64`` — the host image is multi-arch).
    - Operator *pvc_mounts* become ``persistentVolumeClaim`` volumes mounted on
      the **host container only** (read-only unless opted out); the init
      container sees only HOME, so nothing external is exposed at clone time.
    - Operator *secret_mounts* become ``secret`` volumes mounted read-only on
      the **host container only** — a runtime lane; clone-time credentials
      still ride ``envFrom``. A Secret projected as a volume (no ``subPath``)
      is refreshed in place by the kubelet, so a long-lived runner picks up a
      rotated credential without a restart — unlike ``envFrom``, read once at
      container start. Refresh is eventually consistent (kubelet sync, up to
      ~1 min), so the in-sandbox consumer must re-read the file each use — a
      value cached at start defeats the rotation.

    :param job_name: DNS-label-safe Job name (see :func:`_new_pod_name`).
    :param namespace: Namespace the Job is created in.
    :param image: Host image reference to run.
    :param service_account: ServiceAccount the Pod runs as.
    :param host_id: Server-chosen host identity, injected as literal env.
    :param host_name: Server-chosen host display name, injected as literal env.
    :param server_url: URL the host dials back to (baked into the host command).
    :param token_secret_name: Per-Job Secret holding the launch token, projected
        via ``secretKeyRef``.
    :param harness_secret: Name of the harness-credentials Secret projected via
        ``envFrom``, or ``None`` for none.
    :param env_literals: Literal name → value env entries (the resolved
        server-env passthrough). Secrets ride *harness_secret*, not this map.
    :param node_selector: Extra node selector labels, or ``None``. Merged with
        a default ``kubernetes.io/arch: amd64``; an operator-supplied
        ``kubernetes.io/arch`` entry overrides the default.
    :param workspace: Absolute workspace root created by the init container.
    :param clone_dir: Directory the clone lands in, or ``None`` for no clone.
    :param repo_url: Repository clone URL, or ``None`` for an empty workspace.
    :param repo_branch: Branch to clone, or ``None`` for the default branch.
    :param host_config: Deployment-supplied config content merged in by the
        init container under the host's resolved config directory, or ``None``.
        Non-secret by design:
        credentials stay behind ``api_key_ref: env:`` indirection (resolved in
        the sandbox against the ``envFrom`` harness Secret), so embedding the
        content in the init container's command is as safe as the clone URL.
    :param resources: Configured resources block, or ``None`` for the defaults.
    :param pvc_mounts: Normalized PVC mounts (``{claim_name, mount_path,
        read_only}``) added as ``persistentVolumeClaim`` volumes on the host
        container only, or ``None``.
    :param secret_mounts: Normalized Secret mounts (``{secret_name,
        mount_path}``) added as read-only ``secret`` volumes on the host
        container only, or ``None``.
    :param agent_name: Server-resolved built-in agent name the session runs,
        added as the ``omnigent.ai/agent`` classifier label. Stamped verbatim
        when it is already a valid label value, otherwise omitted (extending the
        ``None``/empty → omit fail-safe): the value selects which credential an
        admission policy injects, so it must equal the agent name exactly rather
        than be coerced into a collision with a different name.
    :param backoff_limit: Maximum container restart attempts before the Job
        is marked Failed.
    :param active_deadline_seconds: Hard lifetime cap for the Job.
