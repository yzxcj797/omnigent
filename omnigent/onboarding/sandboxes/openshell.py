"""
NVIDIA OpenShell sandbox launcher.

Implements :class:`~omnigent.onboarding.sandboxes.base.SandboxLauncher`
for `NVIDIA OpenShell <https://github.com/NVIDIA/openshell>`_ sandboxes
on top of the official ``openshell`` Python SDK. Same posture as the
Modal, Daytona, and CoreWeave launchers: the SDK is an optional
dependency (``uv pip install 'omnigent[openshell]'``) imported lazily, so
the provider can be listed and the module probed without it.

OpenShell is self-hosted: a gateway control plane manages sandbox
lifecycle on a configured compute driver (Docker, Podman, microVM,
Kubernetes), filling the gap for on-prem and air-gapped deployments
where cloud providers are unavailable.

Notes that shape this launcher:

- **gRPC, not REST.** OpenShell's control plane is a gRPC service; the
  ``openshell`` SDK wraps it. The launcher connects through
  :meth:`SandboxClient.from_active_cluster`, which resolves the active
  gateway (its endpoint, TLS material, and OIDC token) from the gateway
  selected by ``openshell gateway select`` — i.e. ``$OPENSHELL_GATEWAY``
  or ``~/.config/openshell/active_gateway``. There is no base-URL knob.
- **Custom host image.** Omnigent boots its prebaked host image, which
  rides in ``SandboxSpec.template.image``. The SDK's public ``create``
  takes only a ``SandboxSpec`` and does not re-export the spec
  protobufs, so the spec is built from the generated ``openshell._proto``
  module — the only path to a non-default image.
- **No file-transfer RPC.** OpenShell exposes command execution but no
  upload primitive, so :meth:`put` streams the file's bytes to ``cat``
  over the exec channel's stdin — the same approach NVIDIA's own
  LangChain backend uses.
- **No local port forwarding.** OpenShell has no local→sandbox port
  forward for the in-sandbox App OAuth callback, so the CLI skips that
  auth step automatically (``supports_local_port_forward = False``).
