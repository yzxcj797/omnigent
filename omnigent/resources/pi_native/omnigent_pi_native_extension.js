/**
 * Evaluate a TOOL_CALL policy for a native Pi tool via the Omnigent server's
 * session-level HTTP endpoint (POST /v1/sessions/{sessionId}/policies/evaluate).
 *
 * This is the same endpoint used by the Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor native
 * hooks. It does NOT require an active Omnigent turn context on the harness
 * side — the endpoint evaluates against the session's full policy set directly.
 *
 * Verdict handling (parity with the native hooks):
 *   - POLICY_ACTION_DENY  → block the Pi tool call with the policy reason.
 *   - POLICY_ACTION_ALLOW / UNSPECIFIED (the engine default when no policy
 *       matches) → proceed.
 *   - POLICY_ACTION_ASK   → the server resolves ASK by PARKING this request
 *       (URL-based elicitation: it publishes an approval card to the web UI
 *       and holds the connection until a human resolves it), then returns a
 *       hard ALLOW/DENY — so a writable session never observes a raw ASK here.
 *       The park is realized by a generous client read budget plus re-attach
 *       retries (see the _PARK_* tuning above): if undici severs a long park
 *       (headersTimeout) we re-POST the SAME _omnigent_elicitation_id so the
 *       server re-attaches to the existing elicitation instead of opening a
 *       second approval card. A LEGITIMATE long-poll re-attach (the server is
 *       reachable and still holding the connection) is the only case that may
 *       loop toward the long park ceiling. If a raw ASK ever does come back
 *       (e.g. a read-only caller that cannot park), we re-evaluate up to
 *       _MAX_RAW_ASK_ROUNDS and then fail CLOSED.
 *
 * Fail CLOSED (a block verdict) whenever a usable verdict cannot be obtained:
 * the transient-retry budget for a genuine transport/5xx error is exhausted,
 * a raw ASK never collapses within _MAX_RAW_ASK_ROUNDS, or the long park
 * ceiling is reached. PHASE_TOOL_CALL is the SOLE enforcement point for a
 * native connector tool — the call is never re-checked server-side — so an
 * unevaluable policy MUST block, not proceed. This matches
 * omnigent.policies.types.FAIL_CLOSED_PHASES and the Python native hook's
 * fail_closed_hook_output(PreToolUse) → deny. (pi-native is itself a sole
 * gate, exactly like the Claude / Codex native hooks; an eventually-allowing
 * human-approval gate would defeat its own purpose, so the earlier fail-open
 * posture was wrong here.) A reachable server long-polling a parked ASK is
 * the deliberate exception: that is the human approval window, not an outage,
 * and we keep waiting (re-attaching) rather than blocking.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<{block: boolean, reason: string} | null>} A verdict.
 *   ``{block: true}`` either from a DENY or from failing closed; ``{block:
 *   false}`` on ALLOW; ``null`` only when the gate is structurally disabled
 *   (no server/session configured or no global fetch) so there is nothing to
 *   enforce against.

 *      the runner, so the long-poll IS its park/resolve mechanism).
 *   2. Retry the ``tools/call`` ONCE with ``requestState`` + ``inputResponses:
 *      {elicitationId: {action: "accept" | "decline"}}``. The server re-evaluates
 *      TOOL_CALL policy on the retry (it does not trust the client's claim
 *      blindly), so a still-denied tool stays denied.
 *   3. Cap at one retry; fail CLOSED (``isError: true``, readable message) if the
 *      approval cannot be resolved or the proxy still asks after the retry.
 *
 * (Trade-off: the proxy's ASK already published one approval card, and the
 * evaluate long-poll publishes a second one — the extension cannot re-attach to
 * the proxy-minted elicitation, whose id is in a different namespace. The human
 * resolves the evaluate card to drive the verdict; the proxy card is orphaned.
 * This is a UX wrinkle, not a security gap: the tool only runs on a genuine
 * human accept, and the server re-checks policy on the retry.)
 *
 * Fail-safe: any transport/parse error resolves to a readable tool-result error
 * (``isError: true``) rather than throwing, so a server hiccup never wedges Pi's
 * agent loop.
