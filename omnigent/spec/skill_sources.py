Harness-aware host/plugin skill discovery for the web composer's

The runner's ``_resolve_session_skills`` unions a session's bundled
skills with the *extra* skills its harness surfaces in its own terminal.

``~/.codex/skills``, Cursor ``~/.cursor``), so resolution dispatches to a
per-family provider. Unknown harnesses fall back to the generic host walk

    Pi exposes no *extra* discoverable skills to the menu.

    Pi has its **own** host-skill mechanism: it loads bundle skills via
    ``--skill`` (already carried by ``spec.skills``, which the runner
    unions in separately) and runs its own auto-discovery at runtime,
    sourcing from Pi's internal extension layout. omnigent can't enumerate
    that layout to name/resolve those skills for the menu, so listing any
    would risk surfacing a command Pi can't invoke. Hence the explicit
    no-op (under-report when unsure).

    This is why Pi gets a dedicated provider rather than the generic
    ``~/.claude/skills`` fallback: the fallback's skills are resolvable by
    omnigent on harnesses that have *no* host-skill mechanism of their own
    (the unregistered SDK/CLI harnesses — antigravity, qwen — which route a
    typed skill through omnigent's own resolve+inject), but Pi's competing,
    unenumerable mechanism makes that fallback unsafe. The distinction is
    "does the harness own an unenumerable host-skill mechanism", not the
    vendor.

    :returns: Always an empty list.

# Keyed by harness family (see _harness_family). A harness with no entry
# (qwen, openai-agents, the in-process antigravity SDK, …) falls through to
# _generic_host_skills in resolve_harness_skills — the ~/.claude/skills walk,
# whose skills omnigent resolves+injects regardless of vendor.
#
# The dividing line is whether the harness owns a host-skill mechanism, and if
# so whether omnigent can enumerate it:
#
#   no mechanism            -> generic walk (omnigent injects the skill text)
#   mechanism, enumerable   -> dedicated provider listing what the agent has
#                              (claude, codex, cursor, antigravity/agy)
#   mechanism, unenumerable -> explicit no-op (pi) — listing anything would
#                              risk surfacing a command the harness can't run
#
# agy moved from the first row to the second when it gained plugin + builtin
# skills; it is enumerable (see antigravity_host_skills), so it lists its own.
