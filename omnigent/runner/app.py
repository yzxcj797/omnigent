        The native-pane idle reaper may reclaim an idle pane while a session sits
        between turns. ``NativeServerHarness.run_turn`` forwards into the live
        pane and assumes it exists, so a turn arriving WITHOUT a client handshake
        (a sub-agent or API forward to a long-idle session) would otherwise inject
        into a dead tmux target and lose the message. This re-ensures the pane
        first. Idempotent: a no-op when the harness is not a native CLI harness or
        the pane is already live. Reuses ``create_session_terminal``'s
        ``ensure_native_terminal`` path, so the pane resumes via the vendor CLI's
        own ``--resume`` (no fresh-start, no lost history).

        Detection has two layers: (1) the reaper POPPING the registry entry
        when it reaps (``registry.close()`` -> ``get()`` returns ``None``),
        and (2) an ``is_alive()`` probe when the registry entry exists, catching
        crashed-but-registered panes (tmux killed externally without
        ``close()``). The probe runs only when a turn arrives, not on a
        poll. Every native short-name this can target has a matching
        ``ensure_native_terminal`` branch in ``create_session_terminal``
        (kept in lockstep with ``harness_aliases.NATIVE_HARNESSES``).
