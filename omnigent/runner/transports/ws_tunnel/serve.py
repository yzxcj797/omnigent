"""Runner-side adapter: receive ``request`` frames, dispatch via ASGI,
frame responses back (Phase 4).

Per ``designs/RUNNER.md`` §3 "Sketch of the adapters", the runner
accepts incoming ``request`` frames and calls the runner's FastAPI
app via ASGI directly — no TCP listener needed. Responses are framed
back as ``response.head`` + N × ``response.body`` + ``response.end``.

This module ships the runner-side WebSocket client loop and the ASGI
dispatcher it invokes for each incoming ``request`` frame.

    then dispatches incoming request frames through the runner ASGI
    app. Disconnects retry forever with capped backoff so starting
    the runner before the local server is available is valid.

    When *auth_token_factory* is provided, a fresh bearer token is
    obtained before each reconnect attempt so that expired OAuth
    tokens are transparently refreshed. On HTTP 401, the factory is
    called once more before giving up — this handles the edge case
    where the proactively refreshed token was already near expiry.

    :param app: Runner ASGI application.
    :param server_url: HTTP(S) server base URL, e.g.
        ``"http://127.0.0.1:6767"``.

        ``"runner_0123456789abcdef"``.
    :param runner_version: Runner version string, e.g. ``"0.1.0"``.
    :param auth_token: Optional bearer token for authenticated
        remote tunnel endpoints. Used as the initial token and as
        a fallback when *auth_token_factory* fails.
    :param tunnel_token: Optional secret token that binds this
        WebSocket tunnel to *runner_id*.
    :param auth_token_factory: Optional sync callable that returns
        a fresh bearer token string (or ``None``). Called via
        ``asyncio.to_thread`` before each reconnect. Typical
        implementation: ``lambda: _read_databrickscfg(profile).token``.
    :param on_reconnect: Optional async callback fired after a
        successful reconnect (not on the initial connect). Used
        by the runner to do a catch-up scan for missed messages
        (Step 8.5 Scenario B).
    :param on_activity: Optional sync callback fired for real
        server-to-runner work frames. Tunnel pings are excluded so
        keepalives do not keep an otherwise idle runner alive.
    :param shutdown_event: Optional event that, when set, requests a
        *graceful* tunnel shutdown: the current connection stops reading new
        frames, waits for in-flight ``GET /stream`` dispatch tasks to finish
        (so their ``[DONE]`` end-of-stream frames are emitted), closes the
        WebSocket with a normal close handshake (which confirms the peer
        received those frames), and then ``serve_tunnel`` returns instead of
        reconnecting. This is how the idle reaper tears the tunnel down without
        the server seeing an abrupt drop (``runner_disconnected``).
    :param on_graceful_shutdown: Optional sync callback fired once, on the
        active connection, just before the graceful drain begins. Used to

       the caller's ``_cancel_dispatch_tasks`` so it can't hang shutdown).

    The caller then returns, and its ``async with websockets.connect`` closes
    the socket with a normal close handshake. The handshake completing is the
    confirmation the server read our frames (WebSocket/TCP ordering), which is
    what turns an abrupt ``runner_disconnected`` drop into a clean
    end-of-stream on the server relay. Tunneled-WS channels (browser terminal
    attaches) are not flushed here — they carry no session-status signal and
