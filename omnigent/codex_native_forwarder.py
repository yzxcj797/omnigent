    :param posted_model: Last model already mirrored to Omnigent via an
        ``external_model_change`` post (the dedupe baseline). Seeded from
        the resume/startup model so the spawn default is not echoed back as
        a change; only a later in-TUI ``/model`` switch is mirrored. ``None``
        until seeded.
    :param effort: Latest known Codex reasoning effort for this thread, e.g.
        ``"medium"``. ``None`` means Codex is using its model/default effort.
    :param posted_effort: Last reasoning effort already mirrored to Omnigent
        via ``external_reasoning_effort_change``. ``None`` is a valid mirrored
        value, so ``posted_effort_known`` tracks whether the baseline has been
        seeded.
    :param posted_effort_known: Whether ``posted_effort`` has been mirrored at
        least once. Without this, the initial ``None`` default would be

    :param parent_session_id: Omnigent parent session id, e.g.
        ``"conv_parent"``. Set by ``supervise_forwarder`` so collab-agent
        helpers can register child sessions without extra parameter
        threading.
    :param codex_client: Connected Codex app-server client. Set by
        ``supervise_forwarder`` so child backfill can issue
        ``thread/resume`` requests.
    :param subagents_by_thread: Maps Codex child thread ids to Omnigent child

        mapped to their spawning parent thread id when known, e.g.
        ``{"thread_child": "thread_parent"}``.
    :param subscribed_child_threads: Codex child thread ids whose backlog
        has been replayed for this connection (guards against re-replay

        connection, e.g. ``{"thread_c:turn_c:item-1"}``. In-memory only;
        guards replay-vs-live overlap within one forwarder lifetime.
    :param surfaced_terminal_error_turns: Turn ids whose standalone terminal
        ``error`` notification was already surfaced. Used to suppress a later
        terminal boundary for the same turn.
    :param posted_user_turns: Turn ids whose ``userMessage`` has been
        posted to Omnigent this connection, e.g. ``{"turn_123"}``. Used to
        enforce user-before-assistant ordering: before posting a turn's
        assistant reply, the forwarder recovers and posts the turn's user
        message if the live stream missed it (see

        by turn id, e.g. ``{"turn_123": [_PartialTextBuffer(...)]}``.
        Normal completed items remain the durable source of truth; this
        buffer is only consumed when Codex reports an interrupted turn with no
        completed item for the streamed text.
    :param _anon_item_counters: Per-(thread, turn) counters used to
        assign deterministic positional keys to items that lack a stable

    :param turn_diff_by_turn: Latest aggregated working-tree unified diff
        seen for a turn, keyed by turn id. Codex emits ``turn/diff/updated``
        repeatedly as edits land; only the newest diff is kept and it is
        flushed once at the terminal turn boundary (see

    A real Codex TUI can answer a server-to-client request before the
    Omnigent web/REPL hook does. If the forwarder awaits the Omnigent hook inline,
    it stops draining app-server events and the web UI sees a stuck
    approval card until the hook timeout. This tracker lets the hook
    wait in the background and resolves it once the app-server emits the
    exact ``serverRequest/resolved`` notification for the same request id.

    The key is always non-empty so dedup is never silently disabled.
    Items with stable Codex-assigned ``id`` fields use
    ``threadId:turnId:item.id`` — identical across replay and live
    deliveries of the same item, so the second delivery is correctly
    dropped by the dedup gate.

    Items without a stable ``id`` fall back to a per-(thread, turn)
    positional counter. The counter is peeked here and only advanced by
    the caller after a successful claim. This guarantees *distinctness
    within a turn* (two genuinely different anonymous items get different
    keys) and ensures the key is never ``None`` (which would silently
    disable dedup). It does **not** guarantee cross-delivery dedup for
    anonymous items: if replay and live each deliver an anonymous item in
    the same (thread, turn), both advance the counter from the same
    starting value and therefore collide — one will be dropped. However,
    because Codex emits a stable ``id`` on all durable transcript items
    in practice, this anonymous path is a safety net for malformed events,
    not a primary dedup mechanism.

        anonymous item counters.
    :returns: ``(key, is_anonymous)`` where ``key`` is the dedup key and
        ``is_anonymous`` is ``True`` when a positional counter was used.
