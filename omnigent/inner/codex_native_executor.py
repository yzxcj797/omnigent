    Build Codex ``thread/settings/update`` model / reasoning-effort overrides.

    A model or reasoning-effort change selected in the Omnigent web UI is
    applied to the running native thread via a ``thread/settings/update``
    request (whose ``ThreadSettingsUpdateParams`` carries ``model`` and
    ``effort``); the change persists to this and later turns. ``turn/start``
    itself takes no model/effort — its params are input/context only — which
    is why the picker was previously a no-op. The runner threads the web
    ``/model`` pick into ``config.model`` and the effort into
    ``config.extra["reasoning_effort"]`` (see
    :class:`~omnigent.runtime.harnesses._executor_adapter.ExecutorAdapter`).
    When neither is pinned the override dict is empty and the native
    thread keeps its launch-pinned model — so this is a no-op for
    sessions that never touch the web picker.

    :param config: Per-turn executor config, or ``None``.
    :returns: Override dict for ``thread/settings/update`` params, e.g.
        ``{"model": "gpt-5.3-codex", "effort": "high"}``. Empty when
        nothing is pinned.
