"""OpenAIAgentsSDKExecutor: run agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK.

This executor uses the OpenAI Agents SDK as the agent runtime while keeping
Omnigent as the system of record for tools, policies, and session history.
Omnigent tools are exposed as SDK FunctionTools whose callbacks route back
through the Session's tool registry.

Conversation state is delegated to the SDK's session layer. Each Omnigent
Session gets its own SDK SQLiteSession keyed by the Omnigent session id.

            as the spec-level default — applied when a per-turn
            ``ExecutorConfig.model`` is not set. A non-None
            ``cfg.model`` (set by AP's
            the harness HTTP client when the request carries
            a ``model_override``) wins over this value, so the REPL's
            ``/model`` slash command can shadow the spec model
            per-request. The harness wrap reads
            ``HARNESS_OPENAI_AGENTS_MODEL`` from the spawn env and
            threads the value here so the harness can pin a model
            independently of the per-call ``request.model`` (which AP
            uses to identify the AGENT, not the underlying LLM).
            ``None`` falls back to ``cfg.model`` then the executor's
            built-in default.
        :param base_url_override: Override the OpenAI-compatible base URL
            instead of deriving it from the Databricks profile host.  Set
            from ``HARNESS_OPENAI_AGENTS_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`` (written by
            the Omnigent workflow layer). Required whenever ``gateway_host`` is set.
        :param gateway_host: Gateway workspace host origin, e.g.
            ``"https://example.databricks.com"``.  Set from
            ``HARNESS_OPENAI_AGENTS_GATEWAY_HOST`` (written by the AP
            workflow layer). When set, skips profile host lookup and requires
            the gateway base URL and auth command values.
        :param gateway_auth_command: Shell command that prints a bearer token,
            e.g.
            ``"databricks auth token --host https://example.databricks.com ..."``
            or ``"printf %s sk-..."``. Set from
