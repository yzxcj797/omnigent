"""Shared auth helpers for route handlers.

Provides user identity extraction and permission-check helpers
used by session route handlers. These are thin wrappers over
:mod:`omnigent.server.auth` and
:mod:`omnigent.server.permissions` that handle the ``None``
(disabled) case and raise the appropriate HTTP errors.

``require_access`` and ``get_permission_level`` are ``async def``
because they ultimately hit a synchronous SQLAlchemy permission
store (``is_admin`` + ``get``). Running those queries directly
from the asyncio event-loop thread monopolized the loop for the
full BEGIN / SELECT / COMMIT round trip — load testing showed this
contributing to 300+ ms loop-lag spikes on every session stream
open. Internally these helpers route the sync work through
``asyncio.to_thread`` so the event loop stays responsive.
