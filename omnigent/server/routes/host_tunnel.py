"""Server-side WebSocket endpoint for host tunnels.

Hosts (machines running ``omnigent host``) connect here via
outbound WebSocket. The server sends control frames
(launch/stop runner) over the tunnel; the host process spawns
or terminates runner subprocesses accordingly.

The host sends a ``host.hello`` frame on connect advertising its
version, name, live runner IDs, and harness readiness, then reports
readiness changes while connected. The server validates
``frame_protocol_version`` for version-skew enforcement (strict-major).

The endpoint registers the host in the :class:`HostRegistry`
(in-memory, per-replica) and upserts the host in the ``hosts``
DB table (cross-replica, persistent).

    ``/v1/hosts/{host_id}/tunnel``.

    :param host_registry: In-memory registry of live host
        connections on this replica.
    :param host_store: Persistent store for host registrations
        (cross-replica). Also the credential source for SERVER-MANAGED
        sandbox hosts: a connection presenting the managed-host token
        header authenticates via
        :meth:`HostStore.resolve_launch_token` instead of
        *auth_provider* (sandboxes have no user credentials).
    :param auth_provider: Optional auth provider for user identity.
        When set, the authenticated user is recorded as the host
        owner.
    :param on_host_connect: Optional async callback fired after a
        host's tunnel is established. Receives the ``host_id``.
        Used for reconnect reconciliation.
    :param on_runner_exited: Optional async callback fired when a host
        reports one of its spawned runners died unexpectedly
        (``host.runner_exited``). Receives ``(runner_id, error)``.
        The server wires this to mark the runner's session(s) failed
        and push the cause to the open view — the only failure signal
        for a runner that crashed before connecting its tunnel (so the
        runner-tunnel ``on_runner_disconnect`` path never fires).
    :param on_host_disconnect: Optional async callback fired when
        a host's tunnel closes. Receives the ``host_id``.
    :param on_host_update: Optional async callback fired when a connected
        host reports changed harness readiness. Receives ``host_id`` and owner.
    :param local_single_user: When ``True``, allow a host to re-own a
        ``host_id`` already registered under a different owner — needed
        only for the single-user loopback local server, where the owner
        legitimately changes across an accounts↔header auth-mode flip.
        ``None`` (the default) resolves from ``OMNIGENT_LOCAL_SINGLE_USER``
        so the deployed multi-user server (which never sets it) keeps the
        W2-class host-hijack boundary. Tests pass an explicit bool.
    :param runner_exit_reports: Shared store for ``host.runner_exited``
        reports, read by the runner status endpoint. ``None`` (e.g.
        minimal test wiring) drops the reports.
