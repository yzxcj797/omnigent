"""Process-local record of the most recent native-forwarder event-POST failure.

A native-harness subprocess serves exactly one conversation (see
``app.state.conversation_id`` in ``omnigent/runtime/harnesses/_scaffold.py``),
and its transcript forwarder runs as an ``asyncio`` task in the SAME event loop
as the harness idle-turn watchdog. When the watchdog fires after a stall, the
real cause is often that the forwarder could not POST session events to the
server (e.g. ``ConnectError: No route to host``) — which is logged separately
and otherwise lost, so the user only sees a generic "wedged LLM" reason.

The forwarder records its last exhausted POST failure here so the watchdog can
attach the connectivity cause to the turn-failure reason (issue #1119). The
record is process-global rather than session-keyed because one subprocess
serves exactly one conversation AND runs one turn at a time (the native UI has
a single active turn; the watchdog attributes the recorded failure to that
turn). It carries a monotonic timestamp so the watchdog only blames
connectivity for a failure recent enough to plausibly be the cause of the
stall, and a successful POST clears the slot (:func:`note_post_success`) so a
recovered connection can't have an old failure misattributed to a later,
unrelated stall.
