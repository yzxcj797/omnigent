"""Agent-management tools (``sys_agent_*``).

The orchestrator surface for inspecting and materializing agents. These
tools are **runner-dispatched**: the runner has no in-process stores, so
each proxies the Omnigent server's existing REST endpoints over
``server_client`` (same channel and security posture as the
``sys_session_*`` family in
:mod:`omnigent.tools.builtins.spawn`). They ship as schema-only
:class:`~omnigent.tools.base.Tool` subclasses — the base-class
``invoke`` fails loud if the AP-side path ever reaches them.

- ``sys_agent_get`` → ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/agent`` (a global read of
  the agent bound to any accessible session).
- ``sys_agent_download`` → ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/agent/contents``
  (download a session's agent bundle ``.tar.gz`` to the agent's local
  disk; returns the path).
- ``sys_agent_list`` → ``GET /v1/agents`` + ``GET /v1/sessions`` + a
  local-disk scan (built-in/template agents, agents bound to sessions,
  and locally-authored configs).

See ``designs/ORCHESTRATOR_SYS_TOOLS.md`` for the full surface.

    A **global read**: resolves against any session the caller is

    and the safe summaries of its MCP servers and guardrail policies.
    Requires a ``session_id`` — there is no way to inspect an agent that

    The download exists for inspecting or forking a config — launching

    an agent is only reachable through some session. To fork a built-in,
