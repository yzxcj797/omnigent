"""Working indicator behavior when background tasks run alongside a turn.

The "Working…" shimmer and the ``background-task-pill`` are independent
surfaces:

* While the turn is still active (``running``/``waiting`` — the parent parked
  on its async-work drain of sub-agents / background shells), BOTH show: the
  shimmer reports the live turn and the pill counts the tasks.
* Once the turn has genuinely ended (``idle``) but a background shell outlives
  it, only the pill shows — a "Working…" shimmer there would misread as the
  agent still thinking.

All tests drive the real status edges through the Sessions events route
(the same path the claude-native forwarder posts to), so they are
deterministic — no live LLM turn, whose timing and the openai-agents
executor's handling of a blocked mock would make the assertions flaky.
A new turn is represented by its ``running`` status edge (what a composer
send produces); the per-edge background-tally bookkeeping that send() does
locally is covered by the chatStore unit tests.
