"""Working indicator behavior when background tasks run alongside a turn.

The "Working…" shimmer and the ``background-task-pill`` are independent
surfaces, and the background-shell tally is sticky across turn boundaries
(shells outlive the turn that launched them):

* Turn actively ``running`` with a lingering shell → BOTH show: the shimmer
  reports the live turn and the pill counts the shell.
* Turn genuinely ended (``idle``) with a shell still running → only the pill
  shows; a "Working…" shimmer there would misread as the agent still thinking.

(A claude-native turn-end ``waiting`` is normalized to ``idle`` server-side —
see ``_background_task_delivery_status`` — so the client's "working + shell"
state is the ``running`` case above, not ``waiting``.)

All tests drive the real status edges through the Sessions events route
(the same path the claude-native forwarder posts to), so they are
deterministic — no live LLM turn, whose timing and the openai-agents
executor's handling of a blocked mock would make the assertions flaky.
A new turn is represented by its ``running`` status edge (what a composer
send produces); the per-edge background-tally bookkeeping that send() does
locally is covered by the chatStore unit tests.
