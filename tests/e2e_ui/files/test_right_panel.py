"""E2E: right rail shell soft tab and file viewer.

Execution-logs coverage was dropped: that surface used to be a
``SessionRail`` card but the rail is now tabbed (Files/Changes/Agents)
and the only entry point left is the ``md:hidden`` mobile session menu —
unreachable on the desktop viewport these tests run at.

    The terminal session fixture registers the test agent and creates a

    - the agent-launched shell appears as a closable soft tab in the rail,
      its xterm connects inline when the tab is opened, and closing the tab
      (after the confirm) kills the terminal;
    - the Files tab can open a workspace file and the file viewer renders
      its contents.

    The file is seeded via the filesystem API rather than relying on the
    agent's terminal ``printf`` to write it: the agent's workspace cwd
    differs by environment (empty on CI), and the changed-files panel only
    refreshes on turn active→idle, so a late PTY write races the refresh.
    The terminal launch above is the real terminal coverage; the file
    viewer just needs a deterministic file present in the scanned workspace.
