"""E2E: creating a shell from the tab strip's "+" menu and typing into it.

The right rail's tab strip carries a "+" ("Open new") menu whenever the
session agent declares a non-empty ``terminals:`` block (``NewTabMenu`` in
``web/src/shell/WorkspacePanel.tsx``). Picking "Shell" with a single
declared terminal name creates it directly, POSTing ``/resources/terminals``
and opening the new terminal as a rail tab (its xterm renders in the rail's
content slot). None of this needs an LLM turn — the user, not the agent,
launches the shell — so these tests never send a chat message.

Three behaviors are covered:

1. **"+" → Shell launches and opens a shell.** Picking Shell creates a
   ``zsh`` shell that opens as a rail tab (``zsh · u-…``): its xterm
   connects in the rail's content slot, the chat page is left undisturbed,
   and the tab's "x" closes it (after a confirm) and kills the terminal.

2. **The user can type a command into the shell.** We type ``pwd`` into
   the connected shell and assert it keeps running — the keystrokes are
   accepted and the bridge does not error or close. We deliberately do
   NOT assert on the command's output: xterm renders to a WebGL canvas,
   so stdout is not in the DOM (the same reason
   ``files/test_right_panel.py`` only checks ``data-state``), and reading
   it back via a file side-effect proved environment-fragile (the shell's
   cwd and the filesystem-API root coincide locally but not on CI).

3. **The workspace rail preserves its redesigned top inset.** The rail floats
   beside the chat header at the 8px outer inset instead of clearing the
   header like the main-column surfaces.

Both use the function-scoped ``terminal_session`` fixture (registers the
``zsh``-declaring agent and a runner-bound session), so each test gets an
independent session.
