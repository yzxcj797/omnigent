"""
Tests for the codex-native forwarder's model-change sync-back
(:mod:`omnigent.codex_native_forwarder`).

For codex-native, ``config.toml``'s ``model`` key is the cost-policy source
of truth (it is what an in-TUI ``/model`` writes). At subscription and at
each ``turn/started`` the forwarder reads it (``_refresh_model_from_config``,
which delegates to the shared ``read_codex_config_model`` in the bridge
module) onto ``_CodexForwarderState.model`` and mirrors it to the Omnigent server
as an ``external_model_change`` event (→ persisted ``conv.model_override``)
so the cost-budget policy resolves the selected model. The startup/spawn
model IS mirrored (so Omnigent learns the session's model even when unchanged);
only an already-mirrored value is not re-posted.
