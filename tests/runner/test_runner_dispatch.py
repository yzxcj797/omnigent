"""End-to-end runner-dispatch tests: server → runner → spawned harness.

The load-bearing assertion: the runner FastAPI app, when given a
real :class:`HarnessProcessManager`, accepts a
POST /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events?stream=true,
spawns a harness subprocess (using the existing
``omnigent/runtime/harnesses/`` machinery — NOT a parallel impl),
forwards the request to the harness via UDS, and streams the
harness's SSE response back through the runner's own SSE response.

Architecture verified end-to-end:
- A real ``HarnessProcessManager`` is started (writes its instance
  dir, runs orphan sweep, starts the idle reaper).
- A test-only harness module is registered in ``_HARNESS_MODULES``.
- The runner FastAPI app is built with ``process_manager=mgr``.
- The test posts to the runner's
  /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events?stream=true with a message
  body + harness name.
- The runner calls ``mgr.get_client()`` → spawns a uvicorn
  subprocess running the test harness on a UDS → returns the
  per-conversation httpx client.
- The runner POSTs the request to the harness via that client.
- The harness drives an LLM call via ``run_turn`` and streams SSE
  back.
- The runner relays each SSE chunk through to the test client.

The OpenAI-key-gated test runs the full chain against gpt-4o-mini.
The unkeyed test asserts on plumbing only (handler is reached,
503 on bad harness name).

Turn-context recovery tests are also included here (see the
``# ── turn-context recovery ──`` section at the bottom of this
file): verdict-delivery failure retry/signal, ``_resync_turn_state``
edge cases, and the three-factor causal chain.

    The native relay advertises exactly ``ToolManager``'s builtin schemas

    relay is their only tool surface; ``_ensure_comment_relay_started``
    applies this same ``ToolManager(spec).get_tool_schemas()`` ∩

    - **Parity**: the always-on orchestrator/discovery surface (agent
      reads, session reads, async inbox reads/cancels, comment tools)

    - **Gating fidelity**: the spawn writes are relayed per the two
      distinct grants, matching what non-native harnesses get via
      ``request.tools``. ``tools.agents`` permits only the declared
      sub-agent list (send + close, NO create); ``spawn: true`` (set
      by the native wrapper specs) additionally grants create —
      launching arbitrary agents or custom bundles. A regressed gate
