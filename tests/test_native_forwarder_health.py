"""Tests for the process-local native-forwarder POST-failure record.

``omnigent/_native_forwarder_health.py`` is the small shared sink that lets a
native forwarder report a connectivity failure to the harness idle-turn
watchdog (issue #1119). These cover its record / recency / clear contract; the
writer (forwarder retry loops) and reader (watchdog) integrations are tested in
``tests/test_native_post_delivery.py``, ``tests/test_codex_native_forwarder.py``,
and ``tests/runtime/harnesses/test_scaffold.py``.
