    server wrapper strips the ``mcp__omnigent__`` prefix
    before invoking the tool callback. So
    ``_stable_tool_executor`` receives ``"sys_terminal_launch"``,
    NOT ``"mcp__omnigent__sys_terminal_launch"``. An earlier

    ``tool_name.startswith("mcp__")`` — that guard NEVER fired
    in production because the prefix was already stripped, the
    queue never drained, and ``_bridge_one_dispatch`` always
    fell back to a freshly-allocated uuid. Result: observed and
    action_required call_ids didn't match, dedup failed, and
