# Kubernetes sandbox runners (on-demand host Pods)

This Kustomize overlay turns on the **`kubernetes`** managed-sandbox provider: a
`host_type: managed` session spawns a **batch/v1 Job** whose child Pod runs
`omnigent host` as its container entrypoint and dials back to the server over the
existing launch-token tunnel. It layers the RBAC + config the provider needs onto
the base server deployment.

## Launch model: entrypoint-as-host

The runner is launched as a **batch/v1 Job** (one Pod, `backoffLimit: 6`). The
Job's child Pod runs `omnigent host` as its container command. An **init
container** prepares the workspace (`mkdir` + optional `git clone`); the **main
container** then runs `omnigent host` under a tiny PID-1 reaper. The host
re-parents runner processes to PID 1, which the reaper reaps; SIGTERM is
forwarded for graceful shutdown.

The launch token is delivered through a **per-Job Kubernetes Secret** referenced
by the Pod's `secretKeyRef` — it never enters the Pod spec, a command line, or
an audit log. The launcher creates that Secret at provision and deletes it
alongside the Job at terminate.

Because the host is **never started by `exec`-ing into an already-running
container**, this provider needs **no `pods/exec` grant** — and avoids the
exec-into-running-container class of runtime issues entirely. The server SA's
rights are the minimum the launcher calls: create/get/delete Jobs,
list/get Pods (to poll the Job's child), get `pods/log` (start-failure
diagnostics only), create/delete Secrets (the per-Job token), and list events.

## Two-namespace, least-blast-radius design

| Namespace | Holds |
|---|---|
| `omnigent` | the server, its DB/PVC, its Secrets, the `omnigent-server` SA |
| `omnigent-sandboxes` | runner Jobs (and their child Pods), the per-Job token Secrets, the harness-creds Secret, the powerless `omnigent-runner` SA, the scoped Role + RoleBinding |

The server SA's Job/Pod/Secret rights are a **namespaced Role** bound
(cross-namespace) to `omnigent-sandboxes` only — so a compromised server can
manage runner Jobs but **cannot** delete the server/DB Pods, read the server's
Secrets, or execute commands inside any Pod. The runner namespace enforces Pod Security `restricted`;
the generated runner Pod is already restricted-compliant (non-root uid 1000, drop
`ALL` caps, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`, no privilege escalation).

## Agent classifier label (`omnigent.ai/agent`)

Each runner Pod is stamped with `omnigent.ai/agent: <name>` naming the built-in
agent its session runs, so an admission policy (or any Pod selector) can tell
which agent a managed runner is running and augment it — the motivating case is
injecting a workload-scoped credential into only the Pods running a given agent.

The value is a **join key you write into your policy**: it equals the agent name
exactly. The label is stamped only when two conditions hold, and is **omitted**
otherwise — the server never emits a mangled or colliding value:

- The session is bound to a **genuine built-in** (operator-seeded) agent. A
  session-scoped agent whose name merely matches a built-in's fails the gate by
  design, so a caller cannot self-classify a runner into another agent's
  identity and attract its credential.
- The agent name is **already a valid Kubernetes label value**. A name that
  would need lossy rewriting is dropped rather than coerced, because two
  distinct names must never collapse onto one credential-selecting value.

### Lifecycle — when a session loses the label

The classifier is re-derived from the bound agent at every launch and relaunch;
it is never persisted. Some ordinary UI actions therefore drop it:

- **Fork** and **switch-agent** mint a fresh *session-scoped* clone of the
  agent. That clone fails the built-in gate, so the forked/switched session's
  runner gets **no** `omnigent.ai/agent` label — and therefore no
  policy-injected credential.
- **Switching back does not restore it.** Switch-back takes the same path and
  mints another session-scoped clone, so a switched session cannot regain the
  label through the UI. Start a new session on the built-in agent instead.
- **A running Pod keeps the previous agent's label until it is replaced.** The
  label is a launch-time snapshot; Pods are not relabelled in place. A changed
  value lands on the next runner Pod (a relaunch after the sandbox dies), not on
  the live one.

Whichever condition fails, the omission is logged — check these first when a
runner Pod unexpectedly carries no credential:

- Failing the built-in gate logs from `resolve_managed_agent_label`
  (`omnigent/server/managed_hosts.py`), e.g. "agent … is not a genuine built-in;
  omitting agent label".
- A name that is not a valid label value logs a `WARNING` from
  `build_job_manifest` (`omnigent/onboarding/sandboxes/kubernetes.py`), e.g.
  "agent … is not a valid omnigent.ai/agent value; runner Pod … stays
  unclassified". Note the gate upstream will already have logged this agent as
  classified, so this is the line that explains the missing label.

### What the label does not do

The server will not stamp a value the session is not entitled to, but the label
is only as trustworthy as the layer that reads it. **A Pod label is an assertion
by whoever created the Pod**, so before keying anything privileged on it:

- **Restrict who can create Pods in the runner namespace.** Any principal with
  `create` (or `patch`) on Pods there can set `omnigent.ai/agent` to any value.
  The server's gate constrains what *the server* stamps, nothing else.
- **Have the webhook verify the creating identity**, not just the label — e.g.
  that `AdmissionReview.request.userInfo.username` is the server's service
  account. Without this, the label alone is forgeable by a namespace-adjacent
  principal.
- **Write the policy fail-closed**: inject *when* the label matches, rather than
  granting a permissive baseline to Pods without one. Resolution is best-effort
  — a transient store error degrades to an unclassified runner — so absence must
  never mean "more access". Note the inverse risk if you key a *restriction* on
  the label: a Pod that loses it also leaves the restricted set, so build
  restrictions as a default-deny base with this label as the allow-exception.
- **Treat a credential as bound to the Pod, not the session.** A mutating
  webhook injects at Pod creation, and `switch-agent` keeps the same runner
  (host and workspace are untouched), so a session that switches from a
  credentialed agent keeps that credential mounted for the Pod's remaining
  lifetime while running the new agent. If that matters, avoid switch-agent for
  credentialed agents or keep the sandbox's idle timeout short.

## Prerequisites

1. **A server image built with the `kubernetes` extra.** The overlay's
   `images:` block already points at the official `omnigent-server-kubernetes`
   variant, which includes it — nothing to build. If you self-build instead,
   keep `kubernetes` in `OMNIGENT_EXTRAS` (see `deploy/docker`) or
   `_ensure_sdk()` fails every launch, and point `images:` at your build.
2. **Harness credentials.** The runners read their LLM / git credentials from a
   Secret named by `secret_name` (default `omnigent-creds`); you create it out of
   band after applying the overlay — see step 2 of **Apply**. It is deliberately
   not checked in; for production prefer a sealed-secret / external-secrets Secret.

## Apply

```sh
# 1. RBAC, the runner namespace, the server sandbox config, and the Deployment patch.
kubectl apply -k deploy/kubernetes/overlays/sandbox-runners

# 2. The harness-credentials Secret the runners read — created out of band, like
#    the OIDC secret in ../../README.md. Add only the keys your agents use.
kubectl create secret generic omnigent-creds -n omnigent-sandboxes \
  --from-literal=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Step 1 creates the runner namespace, both ServiceAccounts, the scoped Role +
RoleBinding, and the server `sandbox:` config, and patches the server Deployment
to run as `omnigent-server` with the config mounted. Step 2 supplies the model /
git credentials — see [Model credentials](#model-credentials-llm-keys) and
[Git credentials](#git-credentials-private-repositories) below for which keys to
set (and a sealed-secret / external-secrets operator for production).

> **The `secret_name` Secret must exist before the first managed launch.** Its
> `envFrom` is non-optional, so a runner Pod whose Secret is missing never starts
> — it stalls in `CreateContainerConfigError` rather than launching without
> credentials. Create it (step 2) right after the `kubectl apply -k` in step 1.

## Server auth (managed hosts)

There are two kinds of credential here: the **server-connection** auth below, and
the **model** keys in the next section — keep them separate.

A managed sandbox opens two connections back to the server. The **host tunnel** is
authenticated by the per-launch token directly — the per-Pod token Secret, always
works. But each session's **runner tunnel**, opened by the runner the host spawns,
authenticates with whatever *server* credential it can resolve — **not** the host
token. So how you front the server matters:

- **Header / OIDC-proxy auth, or single-user (no-auth) servers** — the runner
  tunnel needs no extra identity; managed hosts work out of the box. (Verified
  end-to-end on a header-auth server: a `host_type: managed` session launched a
  runner Pod and ran a Claude turn on an injected `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.)
- **The built-in `accounts` provider (`OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED=1`)** — the runner
  tunnel additionally requires a *user* identity, which the per-launch host token
  does not carry, so the runner dial-back is refused (`403`) even though the host
  tunnel connects. This is a framework-level managed-host interaction shared by
  **all** sandbox providers (Modal / Daytona / Islo / …), not specific to Kubernetes.

So front the server with **header or OIDC auth** — a reverse proxy / IdP injects
the user identity on every request, including the runner WebSocket (see
[`deploy/README.md`](../../../README.md#auth)) — or run it single-user.

## Model credentials (LLM keys)

A fresh runner Pod has no model keys. They ride the **`omnigent-creds` Secret**
(`secret_name`, projected into every Pod via `envFrom`) created in [Apply](#apply);
the in-sandbox host forwards the standard harness credential vars to its runners.
Which variables to inject — first-party APIs, gateways (`*_BASE_URL`),
subscriptions — is identical to Modal; see the [variable table and per-plan
recipes](../../../modal/README.md#llm-credentials-for-managed-sandboxes). For a
Claude **subscription**, run `claude setup-token` on your own machine (one-time
browser auth) and inject the long-lived token as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. For
env vars beyond the standard harness set, also set
`OMNIGENT_RUNNER_ENV_PASSTHROUGH=NAME1,NAME2`.

## Git credentials (private repositories)

Inject an HTTPS token as `GIT_TOKEN` (GitLab: add `GIT_USERNAME=oauth2`) into the
`omnigent-creds` Secret. The host image's git credential helper answers HTTPS auth
from it for both the launch-time clone and the agent's later `fetch` / `push`,
writing nothing to disk — use HTTPS repository URLs. Details by provider match the
[Modal git guide](../../../modal/README.md#git-credentials-private-repositories).

## Configuration (`sandbox-config.yaml`)

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `server_url` | URL the runner Pod's host dials back to (in-cluster service DNS by default). |
| `host_config` | Optional, top-level under `sandbox:` (provider-agnostic, not inside `kubernetes:`): verbatim in-sandbox `~/.omnigent/config.yaml` content installed before `omnigent host` starts — e.g. a `providers:` block routing the `pi` harness through a self-hosted gateway (LiteLLM/vLLM). Server-managed: entries injected by a previous launch are replaced or removed on the next launch/resume; config created inside the sandbox survives. Keep secrets out via `api_key_ref: env:VAR`, resolved inside the runner Pod against the `secret_name` Secret. Validated at server startup. |
| `namespace` | Runner-Pod namespace (defaults to `omnigent-sandboxes`). |
| `secret_name` | Harness-creds Secret projected into every Pod via `envFrom`. |
| `service_account` | ServiceAccount the runner Pods run as (powerless). |
| `image` | Optional runner image override (defaults to the official multi-arch amd64/arm64 host image). |
| `env` | Optional list of SERVER env-var names to inject as literal Pod env (prefer `secret_name` for credentials). |
| `node_selector` | Optional extra node labels, merged with a default `kubernetes.io/arch: amd64` — set that key to `arm64` to schedule runners on arm64 nodes. |
| `resources` | Optional `requests` / `limits` (`cpu` / `memory`) override. |
| `in_cluster` | Optional cluster-config source: `true` (in-cluster SA only), `false` (kubeconfig only), omit (try in-cluster, then kubeconfig). |
| `kubeconfig` | Optional kubeconfig path for the out-of-cluster fallback (env: `OMNIGENT_KUBERNETES_KUBECONFIG`). |
| `pvc_mounts` | Optional pre-created PersistentVolumeClaims mounted into every runner Pod — see [Persistent storage mounts](#persistent-storage-mounts-pvc_mounts). |

## Persistent storage mounts (`pvc_mounts`)

Runner Pods are ephemeral by design — the workspace lives on an `emptyDir` and
dies with the Pod. To expose durable data (datasets, model caches, shared
output directories) mount pre-created PersistentVolumeClaims:

1. Create the PV/PVC **in the runner namespace** (`omnigent-sandboxes`) out of
   band — via your GitOps repo, with whatever backend your cluster provides
   (NFS/SMB CSI drivers, SAN, cloud disks). Omnigent only references the claim;
   it never creates volumes, so the server RBAC stays unchanged.
2. List the claims under `sandbox.kubernetes.pvc_mounts` (see
   `sandbox-config.yaml`). Mount paths may not overlap `/home/omnigent`, the
   OS directories, or their ancestors (e.g. `/home`, `/var`) — the server
   rejects such config at startup.

Caveats:

- **Multiple runners share writable claims concurrently** — use a
  `ReadWriteMany`-capable backend (NFS/SMB/CephFS) for anything writable, and
  prefer `read_only: true` (the default) everywhere else: a writable shared
  mount lets one session's agent read and modify what another session wrote,
  and anything written there outlives the Pod and its launch token.
- Runner Pods run as uid/gid 1000660000 with `fsGroup`. NFS `root_squash` and
  SMB ownership mapping must permit that identity (export to the uid, or use
  CSI mount options like `uid=`/`gid=` for SMB); `fsGroupChangePolicy:
  OnRootMismatch` avoids re-chowning large exports on every start.
- `ReadWriteOnce` claims pin all runners to one node — combine with
  `node_selector` deliberately, or the second Pod sits `Pending`.
- A mount visible in the Pod is not automatically visible to a harness's own
  OS-level sandbox (OmniBox path grants are separate).

To verify `host_config` end to end against a live cluster, run
`python tests/e2e/integrations/deploy/kubernetes/e2e_managed_host_config.py
--server <url>` — it creates a managed session and asserts the injected
config inside the runner Pod.

## Troubleshooting

- **Launch fails fast with a clear reason.** When a Pod can't schedule, pull its
  image, or clone its repo, the launch error carries the diagnosis — recent Pod
  events and a tail of the failed container's log (e.g. the `git clone` error
  from the init container). No need to catch the Pod before it's reaped.
- **Inspect a stuck launch:** `kubectl describe pod <pod> -n omnigent-sandboxes`
  and `kubectl logs <pod> -n omnigent-sandboxes -c host` (or `-c workspace-prep`
  for the clone step).
- **403 on launch:** the server SA is missing the Role — re-apply this overlay
  and confirm the cross-namespace RoleBinding subject namespace is `omnigent`.
- **Runner Pod stuck in `CreateContainerConfigError`:** the `secret_name` Secret
  (`omnigent-creds`) doesn't exist in the runner namespace — its `envFrom` is
  non-optional, so the Pod can't start. Create it (see [Apply](#apply)).
- **Host comes online but the session hangs / 403s on the first message:** the
  server is using the built-in `accounts` provider, which doesn't support the
  managed runner dial-back — see [Server auth](#server-auth-managed-hosts) (use
  header/OIDC auth, or run single-user).
- **401 / "could not load Kubernetes configuration":** out of cluster, the server
  can't find a kubeconfig — set `kubeconfig` (or `OMNIGENT_KUBERNETES_KUBECONFIG`),
  or unset `in_cluster: true` if it isn't actually running in the cluster.
