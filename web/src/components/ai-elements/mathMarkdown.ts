/**
 * LLMs often emit TeX delimiters (`\(...\)` and `\[...\]`), while remark-math
 * parses dollar delimiters. Convert both to `$$`, the only math delimiter the
 * renderer honours (single-dollar math is off, so prose dollars stay prose —
 * see `STREAMDOWN_PLUGINS`), but only where doing so is safe:
 *
 * - Not inside fenced or inline code, so code examples stay verbatim.
 * - Not inside an already `$$`-delimited math span, so a LaTeX line break
 *   (`\\[1em]`) inside `$$\begin{aligned}…\end{aligned}$$` isn't mistaken for a
 *   display-math opener and turned into `\$$1em]`.
 * - A literal `\\` or `\$` is copied verbatim so its trailing `\[`/`\(` isn't
 *   read as an explicit delimiter and an escaped dollar isn't re-toggled.
 *
 * `$$…$$` inside a paragraph stays inline math, so a converted `\(x\)` reads as
 * inline math and only a `$$` opening its own line renders as a display block.
