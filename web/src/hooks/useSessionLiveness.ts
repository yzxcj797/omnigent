/**
 * The open session's liveness, derived from the runner tunnel, the host
 * tunnel, host-binding, and the caller's ownership. Exactly one variant
 * is active at a time and each maps to a distinct affordance:
 *
 * - `online` — the runner tunnel is registered; normal chat.
 * - `starting` — a relaunch is in-flight: an asleep session that a
 *   just-sent turn is waking right now (runner down, host up, a turn in
 *   flight). Transient and expected — the open view shows a passive
 *   "Connecting…" indicator (terminal-first sessions show the pill's own
 *   spinner), the composer stays open, and there's nothing to act on.
 *   Distinct from `runner_asleep`, which is an idle session whose runner
 *   is down with no turn yet trying to wake it. (Runner liveness is
 *   poll-driven — the real-time `session.runner_status` push was removed
 *   upstream — so the *initial* cold launch of a brand-new session isn't
 *   specially flagged here; its terminal-pill spinner comes from
 *   `terminalPending` once the runner connects.)
 * - `runner_asleep` — runner down, host up, and no turn in flight. The
 *   host relaunches the runner on the next message, so the composer stays
 *   open. The open view renders no banner for this state — typing
 *   silently relaunches the runner (which then flips it to `starting`).
 * - `host_asleep` — the session is host-bound, the host tunnel is down, but
 *   the host is a resumable managed host: the server wakes the sandbox on the
 *   next message (the send-message relaunch path calls `resume_managed_host`).
 *   Treated like `runner_asleep` — the composer stays open, no reconnect
 *   banner, and typing wakes it. This is what makes the backend resume
 *   reachable from the web; without it a resumable host would dead-end on
 *   `host_offline` below. While a just-sent turn is waking it (`turnActive`),
 *   this upgrades to `starting` so the ~85s cold wake shows a "Connecting…"
 *   intermediate rather than a blank screen.
 * - `host_offline` — the session is host-bound and the host tunnel is down,
 *   and the host is NOT resumable from the web (an external/laptop host, or a
 *   managed provider without a stop/resume lifecycle). The owner must
 *   reconnect the host from that machine (`isOwner` true), and any viewer can
 *   fork to continue independently.
 * - `local_stranded` — not host-bound (no `host_id`) and the runner is
 *   down. There's no host to relaunch it; the user restarts from their
 *   own machine, and forking is the escape hatch.
 * - `unknown` — liveness hasn't been observed yet for this session (not
 *   polled, no stream row). Callers must NOT block on this — treat it as
 *   "assume online until proven otherwise" so a not-yet-resolved poll
 *   doesn't flash a reconnect banner over a live session.

 * stranded: surface `starting` rather than a reconnect banner until the
 * grace window lapses. A confirmed host-down splits on resumability: a
 * resumable managed host is `host_asleep` (row 3 — wakeable by sending a
 * message, composer open), a non-resumable one is `host_offline` (row 3' —
 * reconnect / fork).
 * Pre-poll `undefined` (row 4) stays `unknown` so a not-yet-resolved poll
 * doesn't flash a banner over a live session. A known-down runner with a
 * live host then splits on whether a turn is in flight: a just-sent turn
 * means the host is relaunching the runner *now* → `starting` (row 5);
 * otherwise it's idle `runner_asleep` (row 5'). Runner liveness is
 * poll-driven (the real-time `session.runner_status` push was removed
 * upstream).
 *
 * @param sessionId The open conversation's id, or undefined when none is
 *   open. Undefined yields `unknown`.
 * @param conv The open session's liveness row (carries `host_id`,
 *   `permission_level`, and `host_resumable`). Null/undefined while loading;
 *   the host-bound vs. local distinction, ownership, and the
 *   host_asleep-vs-host_offline split read from it.
 * @param opts.turnActive Whether a turn is currently in flight for the
 *   open session (the user just sent, or a cross-client turn is running).
 *   When the runner is down but the host is up, this upgrades the idle
 *   `runner_asleep` state to `starting` — the relaunch is happening now,
 *   so the user sees a "Connecting…" intermediate instead of a silent gap.
 * @param opts.launchedAt Epoch ms when this client last asked a host to
 *   launch a runner outside the send path (a host switch). Extends the
