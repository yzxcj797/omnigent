 * refresh. The query's `staleTime` converges it later.
 *
 * The PATCH returns a `SessionResponse` snapshot, which carries `labels` but
 * NOT `updated_at` (only the list endpoint's `SessionListItem` has it). So the
 * row inserted into the pinned cache is built from the existing cached row (for
 * its `updated_at`, `title`, etc.) with the server-confirmed `labels` overlaid
 * — never from the raw PATCH response, which would leave the row without a
 * timestamp until the pinned query refetched (a blank time field on the new
 * row). For the same reason the list overlay carries only `labels`, so pinning
 * can't blank an existing row's timestamp.
 *
 * Old-server fallback: when the server can't store pins (`filterHonored` is
 * false — a pre-upgrade server that ignores `?pinned=true`), a PATCH would
 * persist a bare `omnigent.pinned` key that the upgraded server discards on
 * read (it only surfaces the caller's per-user `omnigent.pinned.<user>` key),
 * so the pin would silently vanish on the server upgrade. Instead we write the
 * pin to localStorage — the same store the pre-upgrade UI used — so it survives
 * and later migrates through `useMigrateLocalPinsToServer` like any other
 * pre-upgrade pin. The optimistic cache patch still runs, and the sidebar
 * unions localStorage pins into the Pinned section, so it shows immediately.
