// Module-scope Zustand store for the active chat session.
//
// The streaming state lives outside the React tree so it survives
// component remounts, route changes, and any UI shuffling. The
// session SSE stream is the source of truth — `switchTo` owns its
// lifecycle, opening `GET /v1/sessions/{id}/stream` on bind and
// pumping events into `state.blocks` via the BlockStream reducer.
// `send` POSTs a single event to the session; the open stream
// delivers the response.
//
// Data model:
//   - `blocks: AnyBlock[]` — committed history + streaming output.
//     The renderer walks this. Bind hydration prepends the committed
//     item history; the live pump appends stream-delivered blocks at
//     the end. Dedupe by `ctx.itemId` so stream-delivered persisted
//     items don't double-render alongside hydrated ones.
//   - `pendingUserMessages` — user inputs that have been POSTed but
//     not yet observed via `session.input.consumed`. Held off `blocks`
//     so streaming output from a prior turn can append cleanly at the
//     end without needing special positional logic. The renderer
//     displays them as user bubbles after the `blocks`-derived ones,
//     and they migrate into `blocks` (plain append) the moment their
//     `session.input.consumed` event arrives.
//
// Actions:
//   send(text, agentId, opts)
//     POSTs `{type: "message", ...}` to /events. The server returns
//     the persisted item id synchronously; we push it onto
//     `pendingUserMessages` so the bubble renders immediately. For a
//     brand-new session, we first createSession + bindStream, then
//     navigate via opts.onConversationCreated, then post. For an
//     existing session whose stream has died (idle proxy disconnect),
//     we rebind before posting so the response events aren't published
//     into an empty subscriber set.
//   stop()
//     POSTs `{type: "interrupt"}` to /events. The local stream
//     stays open; the server emits `session.interrupted` and
//     `response.incomplete` which the pump handles.
//   switchTo(convId)
//     Single owner of stream-bind. Aborts the prior stream, resets
//     state, then for non-null `convId` opens the new session's
//     stream, fetches the items snapshot, and merges into blocks
//     deduping by item id.
