// Block walker — converts a flat `AnyBlock[]` into a list of bubble
// groups for the JSX layer to map over.
//
// Walks a single flat list (the same one the store holds) and groups
// by `responseId` for bubble layout. Lifecycle for the most recent
// response comes from the store's `activeResponse` sidecar.
//
// Hides four concerns the JSX layer shouldn't touch:
//   1. Splitting the flat block list into bubble groups (user
//      message → its own bubble; assistant blocks under the same
//      `responseId` → one assistant bubble; compaction → standalone).
//   2. Grouping consecutive same-kind blocks (text runs, reasoning
//      runs) into single render-items inside an assistant bubble.
//   3. Joining `tool_group` blocks with their matching `tool_result`
//      blocks by `callId` so the tool card has its output inline.
//   4. Deriving the tool's UI status from block fields plus the
//      bubble's lifecycle (running / completed / errored / cancelled).
//
// Pure function. No React, no DOM. Tested in `renderItems.test.ts`.
