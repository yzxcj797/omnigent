// A deliberately thin Electron wrapper around the existing web UI. It bundles

// server URL and, if present, load it directly so the user lands in the same
// UI they'd see in a browser — now with OS-native notifications and a
// dock/taskbar badge (wired up on the web side via `src/lib/nativeBridge.ts`,
// which detects the Electron preload on `window.omnigentDesktop`).
//
// The "load the server's own SPA" model means there is ZERO UI duplication
// here: change the web app and the desktop app changes with it on next launch.
